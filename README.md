# Hamiltonian Path Search in a Grid with Obstacles

## Problem Description
Given a 2D grid where each cell is either open or blocked, a robot can move in four directions: **up, down, left, right**.  
The goal is to count the number of **unique paths** that visit **every open cell exactly once**.

This is a variation of the Hamiltonian Path problem applied to a rectangular grid with obstacles.

Grid:
"A . . . \n. . . . \n. . . .\nx . . B"
